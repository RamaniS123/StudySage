# StudySage

StudySage is an AI-powered note-taking web application built to help students study more effectively. It leverages a PostgreSQL database via Supabase to store user notes and authentication data, uses a Prisma ORM for seamless database interaction, and integrates the OpenAI API to provide intelligent features like note summarization, AI-powered Q&A, and quiz generation. The frontend is built with Next.js 15 using the App Router, and styled with shadcn/ui for a clean, responsive user experience.
